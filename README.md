[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FGwonsooLee%2Fgoployer.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FGwonsooLee%2Fgoployer?ref=badge_shield)

`goployer` is an application you can use for EC2 deployment. You can deploy in a blue/green mode. goployer only
changes the autoscaling group so that you don't need to create another load balancer or manually attach autoscaling group to target group.
<br><br>
`goployer` is still **in development** and we need the feedback from you for faster improvements. Any feedback from any channel is welcome.
<br><br>

## # Requirements
* You have to create a load balancer and target groups of it which goployer attach a new autoscaling group to. 
* If you want to setup loadbalancer and target group with terraform, then please check this [devopsart workshop](https://devops-art-factory.gitbook.io/devops-workshop/terraform/terraform-resource/computing/elb-+-ec2).
* Please understand how goployer really deploys application before applying to the real environment.
<br>

## # How goployer works
* Here's the steps that goployer executes for deployment
1. Generate new version for current deployment.<br>
If other autoscaling groups of sample application already existed, for example `hello-v001`, then next version will be `hello-v002`
2. Create a new launch template. 
3. Create autoscaling group with launch template from the previous step. A newly created autoscaling group will be automatically attached to the target groups you specified in manifest.
4. Check all instances of all stacks are healty. Until all of them pass healthchecking, it won't go to the next step.
5. (optional) If you add `autoscaling` in manifest, goployer creates autoscaling policies and put these to the autoscaling group. If you use `alarms` with autoscaling, then goployer will also create a cloudwatch alarm for autoscaling policy.
6. After all stacks are deployed, then goployer tries to delete previous versions of the same application.
   Launch templates of previous autoscaling groups are also going to be deleted.

## # How to run goployer
* Before applying goployer, please make sure that you have made [manifest](#Manifest).
* Here are options you can use with command line
    * `--manifest` : manifest file path
    * `--ami` : AMI ID
    * `--assume-role` : arn of IAM role you want to assume
    * `--stack` : the stack value you want to use for deployment
    * `--region` : the ID of region to which you want to deploy instances
    * `--slack-off` : whether turning off slack alarm or not. (default: false)
    * `--log-level` : level of Log (debug, info, error)
    * `--extra-tags` : extra tags to set from command line. comma-delimited string(no space between tags)
        -  ex) `--extra-tags=key1=value1,key2=value2`
    * `--ansible-extra-vars` : extra variables to be used in ansible. Will be added to tag with `ansible-extra-vars` key.
* If you sepcifies `--ami`, then you must have only one region in a stack or use `--region` option together.
* You *cannot run goployer from local environment* for security & management issue.
```bash
$ make build 
$ ./bin/goployer --manifest=configs/hello.yaml --ami=ami-01288945bd24ed49a --stack=<stack name> --region=ap-northeast-2
```
<br>

## # Spot Instance
* You can use `spot instance` option with goployer.
* There are two possible ways to use `spot instance`.


`instance_market_options` : You can set spot instance options and with this, you will only use spot instances.
```yaml
    instance_market_options:
      market_type: spot
      spot_options:
        block_duration_minutes: 180
        instance_interruption_behavior: terminate # terminate / stop / hibernate
        max_price: 0.2
        spot_instance_type: one-time # one-time or persistent
```
<br>  
  
`mixed_instances_policy` : You can mix `on-demand` and `spot` together with this setting. 
  
```yaml
    mixed_instances_policy:
      enabled: true
      override_instance_types:
        - c5.large
        - c5.xlarge
      on_demand_percentage: 20
      spot_allocation_strategy: lowest-price
      spot_instance_pools: 3
      spot_max_price: 0.3
```
 
You can see the detailed information in [manifest](#Manifest) section.

## Manifest
Manifest file is the configurations for application deployment. You need to set at least one stack for each application. You can find the example manifest file in `config/hello.yaml`.
```yaml
